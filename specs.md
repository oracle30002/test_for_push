Objective

This worksheet helps you learn how to explore open-source repositories on GitHub and understand the process of making contributions. You will work with real repositories related to deep learning, focusing on navigation and local modifications to practice open-source workflows.

 

Repositories to Choose From

You can choose one repository from the list below or select another deep-learning-related repository of your interest.

OpenCV: A popular library for computer vision and image processing.
MONAI: A library for deep learning in medical imaging.
TensorFlow: A widely used deep learning framework.
PyTorch: A flexible and powerful deep learning framework.
DeepChem: A library for deep learning in chemistry and drug discovery.
MedicalNet: A repository with pre-trained 3D medical models.
Kuwa GenAI OS: An open, free, secure, and privacy-focused Generative-AI Orchestrating System.
 

 
 

Part 1: Repository Exploration

Choose and Clone a Repository:
Select a repository from the list above or choose your own deep-learning-related repository.
Fork the repository on GitHub.
Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
Answer the Following Questions:
What is the primary purpose of this repository?
Identify one key file or script in the repository and briefly explain its function.
 

Part 2: Practice GitHub Workflow

Create a Branch:
Create a new branch in your local repository (e.g., update-readme).
Make Local Changes: Choose one of the following tasks to perform locally
Add a section to the README file, such as “How to Run the Script” or an example usage.
Enhance or clarify comments in the code of a specific script.
Correct a typo or improve formatting in the documentation.
Stage and Commit Your Changes:
Stage your changes using git add filename.
Commit your changes with a descriptive message using git commit -m “Your message”.
Document the Process:
Take screenshots of your terminal showing the Git commands you used.
Provide a brief description of the changes you made and their purpose.
 

Part 3: Reflection

Write a short reflection addressing the following:

What did you learn about using GitHub through this assignment?
What challenges did you face, and how did you overcome them?
How can contributing to open-source projects benefit your understanding of deep learning?
 

Additional Documentation for Pull Requests

If you submit a pull request, include:

A screenshot of the pull request (PR) page and the link to your pull request.
A brief description of the changes in your PR (similar to what you wrote in the PR description).
Submission Requirements

Submit your assignment as a PDF file to ee-class before 2025-01-09 23:00.
Submission format:
File Type: Submit your completed worksheet as a PDF document.
File Naming Convention: Please name your file as “1131_CE6146_ID_ GitHub.pdf”.
If your submission does not meet these requirements, 5 points will be deducted from your total score.
